                <h2>The Setter</h2>
                <h5>"Owns the second ball"</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg"><img src="https://dsgmedia.blob.core.windows.net/pub/2018/12/Volleyball-Tips_SetterNeutral.jpg"/div>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8YLyw3nnJ4">Different Sets Used in Volleyball</a>
                <p>The Setter's job in the game of volleyball is to take the second ball and place it in its proper spot for the hitter to then swing at. Generally a setter uses a 'set' which is a skill used to play the ball over your head with your hands apart, and fingers spread. After the your team recieves the ball from a serve or hit, it is the backrow players' job to pass the ball as close to the setter as possible that way they can get a precise set to one of their hitters. The setter postition is crucial to a smooth play because it is necessary to get the ball to the hitter and hopefully earn a point off of their hit. There are also many different types of sets that are used for different hitters and in different spots on the court.  </p>
                <h2>The Libero</h2>
                <h5>"Controls the back row"</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg"><img src="https://www.teamusa.org/-/media/USA_Volleyball/Images/2018-Articles/May/libero.jpg"/div>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QItosl5UGp0">Libero in action (look for the player in white)</a>
                <p>The libero is in charge of the backrow. Generally they are placed in the middle back and it is there job to direct the left and right back players on where to stand and what areas of the court they are in charge of. The libero is normally the best passer on their team, from the stands you will notice that the libero plays in a contrasting color to the rest of their team to help them stand out to the referees. The libero uses normal digging as well as upperhand digging to get the pass as close to the setter as possible. </p>
                <h2>Outside Hitter</h2>
                <h5>"Lives on the left"</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg"><img src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/asp/9ecff968-bd33-40bb-9528-877f71c35e43.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=1000"/div>
                <p>Scroll down to the information about rightside hitters to watch a video about hitters.</p>
                <p>The outside hitter is the most used hitter on the team especially at a young age. The outside's job is to be up at the left hand side of the night and ready to hit when the setter sets them. You will notice that when the ball is in play on their side of the net they are constantely ready to help pass the first ball and are calling out numbers or colors depending on where the want their set to be. When the ball is on the opposite side of the net, the outside is standing right up at the net and it is there job to jump up and block when the opposing team's right side hitter is swinging. </p>
                 <h2>Middle Hitter</h2>
                <h5>"Big Hitter"</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg"><img src="https://connection.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2012/10/02/R1003-351_t670.jpg?b3f6a5d7692ccc373d56e40cf708e3fa67d9af9d"/div>
                <p>Scroll down to the information about rightside hitters to watch a video about hitters.</p>
                <p>The middle hitter is probably the next most commonly used hitter. While is can be difficult to get that perfect set to the middle hitter, when it does occur it is almost always a kill (a point for their side). The middle hitter is generally the tallest player on the team is is normally the player to never pass in the back row, because the libero takes their place. The middle hitter, liek the outside, also must block the opposing teams hits for both the opposing teams middle and outside hitters. </p>
                 <h2>Rightside Hitter</h2>
                <h5>"Slams balls from the right"</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg"><img src="https://d21gd0ap5v1ndt.cloudfront.net/web02/img.php?src=/images/2018-19/Havrisik_VB_web2_10-27-18.jpg&site=pointsky&crop"/div>

                <p>Finally the rightside hitter stands on the right side of the court. They are just like the outside except stand on the opposite edge of the night. The rightside is also used to block the opposing sides hits when it is their outside swinging. </p>
